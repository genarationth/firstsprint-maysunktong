2. For your Exercise Tracker App, design your wireframes using Figma.

* **First**: When the user clicks the CREATE A NEW CARD button, it creates a new Exercise Activity Card that the user can input the activity details.
* **Second**: The user can edit the information in the Exercise Activity Card.
* **Third**: The user can read the information on that card (that is displayed on the app) and can delete that card.

3. Share your Figma design link on this repository.
